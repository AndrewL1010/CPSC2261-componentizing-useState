a) in Form.js the handleChange function keeps track of what is being typed,
by updating the state on change.

b) the editingTemple in the Todo component is showing this template. 
when you click the edit button it sets editing to true and returns the editingTemplate
that is shown. While in the editing template, handleChange keeps track on what 
the user types in the edit name box. Once the User submits the handleSubmit function
uses the editTask from App function to go through the tasks and changes the desired
task to a different name based on id. It sets the state back to empty and sets editing
to false so it renders the viewTemplate again

c) in Form.js when the user submits a new task, the handlesubmits uses the
addTask function from App.js. addTask function creates a newTask, and updates
the state for the tasklist with the new task being appended
